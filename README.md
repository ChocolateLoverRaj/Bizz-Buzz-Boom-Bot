This is a Discord bot for the bizz buzz boom game that one of my teachers introduced my class to. Basically you are in a circle and each player says the next number, starting from 1. On multiples of 2, you say "bizz" instead of the number. On multiples of 3, you say "buzz" instead of the number. On multiples of 5, you say "boom" instead of the number. If it's a multiple of more than one of the special numbers, you say both, such as "bizz buzz" or "buzz boom", and the special one, "bizzi buzz boom!".

Looks like https://mathletenation.com/content/bizz-buzz-bang is a different variation but basically explains the game.
